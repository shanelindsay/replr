\arguments{
\item{code}{Character string of R code to evaluate.}

\item{port}{Server port number.}

\item{plain}{Logical; return plain text (default) or JSON when `FALSE`.}

\item{summary}{Include a summary of the result object.}

\item{output, warnings, error}{Include captured output, warnings and errors.}

\item{full_results}{Logical; if `TRUE`, bypass summarization and include the
full result object. This may produce large responses and expose sensitive

}
\description{
Sends R expressions to a running `replr` server. By default the result is

`full_results = TRUE` to include the complete result object in the response.
