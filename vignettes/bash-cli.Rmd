# Overview

The package includes a Bash script, `clir.sh`, for managing a server from the
command line. Output is plain text by default. Use the `--json` flag to request
structured JSON (requires `jq` for pretty printing). This vignette demonstrates
common tasks such as starting the server, running code and stopping it.

## Starting a server

Run the script from the package root to launch the server on a custom port. The instance is labelled so that subsequent commands know which port to use.

```bash
$ tools/clir.sh start demo 8123
Started 'demo' on port 8123 (PID 12345)
```

## Executing code

Pipe an expression to `exec` to evaluate it remotely. Output is plain text by default; add `--json` for structured JSON.

```bash
$ echo 'sqrt(144)' | tools/clir.sh exec demo
12

$ echo 'sqrt(144)' | tools/clir.sh exec demo --json
{
  "status": "success",
  "output": "",
  "error": "",
  "plots": "",
  "result_summary": {"type": "double"}
}
```

For quick commands you can supply the code directly using `-e`:

```bash
$ tools/clir.sh exec demo -e '1 + 1'
$ tools/clir.sh exec demo -e '1 + 1' --json
```

You can also pipe a script file into `exec`:

```bash
$ tools/clir.sh exec demo < script.R
```

## Checking status

Use the `status` subcommand to verify the server is running.

```bash
$ tools/clir.sh status demo
{
  "status": "running",
  "pid": 12345,
  "port": 8123
}
```

## Stopping the server

When finished, shut down the labelled instance.

```bash
$ tools/clir.sh stop demo
Sent shutdown to 'demo' (port 8123)
```

## Listing instances

All active instances are tracked in `~/.replr/instances`.

```bash
$ tools/clir.sh list
demo:8123:12345
```

The Bash client provides a lightweight interface for integrating `replr` in shell scripts and other command line workflows.
